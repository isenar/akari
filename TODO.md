# Must have
- [ ] error handling instead of panics
- [ ] parse grid from some text/data format, so it's easier to write tests
- [ ] enough test coverage to be comfortable enough toggling works fine
- [ ] some pretty printing for tests to debug errors easily (it's super verbose now)
- [ ] upload to GH
- [ ] Add game rules, so it's actually possible to finish it
- [ ] more grids
- [ ] refactor code (check what can be improved first)

# Nice to have
- [ ] add another frontend, e.g. GUI, like `iced`
- [ ] generate puzzles
- [ ] timer
- [ ] check for errors
